### **Introduction and Data Preparation**

After thorough research, I gathered data from various sources such as WHO [1], United Nations [2], and Kaggle dataset with references to WHO or other reliable sources. The data collected was not clean and required a lot of effort to deal with missing values and interpreting them to make sense. To impute the missing values, I could not use methods like mean, median, max, or min, as they resulted in a substantial increase in the total number of deaths. I also could not leave the missing values as zero because it would have decreased the average number. Therefore, I had to use appropriate methods to impute the missing values to maintain the reliability and accuracy of the dataset.Thus, I had to explore alternative methods that are suitable for a pandemic dataset. After much consideration, I decided to use methods like K-Neighbors, which I implemented using queries in Python.

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) imputation is a method used to fill in missing values in a dataset by using the available data points to predict the missing values. It works by finding the k nearest data points with known values, and using their values to estimate the missing value [3].

In the case of the Covid-19 dataset, there were missing values in different columns such as daily new cases, daily new deaths, and population density for different countries. I decided to use the KNN imputation method to fill in these missing values because it has been shown to be effective in handling datasets with missing values, and it does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data.

Furthermore, there were several columns in the dataset that were irrelevant, and I used queries to delete them. I also merged data from different sources, such as the number of smokers and age group for each country, to analyze their relationship with COVID-19. It was challenging to link the dataset with a foreign key, but I managed to set them up in a manner that was related to the columns. Overall, the data preparation process required significant effort and attention to detail to ensure the data is reliable and accurate for analysis

### **Analysis**
The distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths is not uniform across different continents. As of now, Europe and North America have been the hardest hit regions, followed by Latin America and Asia. The lack of proper statistics and infrastructure for data gathering is a major challenge in accurately tracking the spread of the virus. This issue is particularly severe in developing countries and low-income regions where access to healthcare and technology is limited. Reports submitted to the World Health Organization (WHO) may also not be entirely accurate, especially in countries with weaker healthcare systems, such as in Africa. This highlights the need for greater investment in public health infrastructure and data collection mechanisms to effectively combat pandemics in the future.

While we acknowledge that the data may not be entirely comprehensive or accurate, we have used reliable sources for our study. Firstly, we analyzed the data for each continent, mapping the spread of the disease across the world and presenting the number of cases and deaths to provide a comprehensive picture of the situation. We also calculated the number of deaths and cases per million as a rate for comparison, taking into account the population of the region. To provide more detailed information on Covid-19 situations in individual countries, we linked a page with a drill-out option to the continent page.

As one of the objectives of the study, we added other data to the dataset to identify any predictors of Covid-19 cases and deaths. We tested factors such as extreme poverty, male and female smoking rates, GDP per capita, population density, cardiovascular death rate, and diabetes prevalence, but did not find any meaningful correlations. However, after dividing the population into three age groups (median age or older, over 65, and over 70) and analyzing cases and deaths, we found a slight positive relationship between aging and Covid-19 statistics. Continents with a higher proportion of elderly populations had higher rates of cases and deaths compared to those with a younger population, indicating that age can act as a predictor.

Finally, we used the Power BI tool to predict the number of cases and deaths for the next 12 months from the current date. Visual analysis of the Covid-19 information can significantly enhance our understanding of the situation and provide valuable insights for various purposes.

Also the USA is the most affected country in the world. According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one of the main factors contributing to the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States is the country's population size and density [11]. With over 330 million people, the United States is the third most populous country in the world. The high population density in many urban areas has made it difficult to contain the spread of the virus [12].

Another factor is the delayed response to the pandemic. According to a study by researchers at Harvard University, there were significant delays in implementing widespread testing and other measures to control the spread of the virus in the early stages of the outbreak [13].

The political polarization and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 have also played a significant role in the United States' response to the pandemic. A study by Pew Research Center found that there were significant differences in public perceptions of the virus between Republicans and Democrats [14]. These differences may have contributed to delays in implementing preventative measures and coordinating a unified response across all states and regions.

#### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States can be attributed to a combination of factors, including population size and density, delayed response, political polarization and misinformation, and a decentralized healthcare system. Addressing these factors will be critical in improving the response to future pandemics.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the world, with varying levels of severity across different regions. The data preparation process for analysis required considerable effort and attention to detail, with KNN imputation used to handle missing values. Our analysis found a slight positive relationship between aging and COVID-19 statistics, indicating age can act as a predictor. Additionally, the high number of cases and deaths in the United States can be attributed to factors such as population size and density, delayed response, political polarization, and a decentralized healthcare system. Greater investment in public health infrastructure and data collection mechanisms will be crucial for effectively combating pandemics in the future. Visual analysis of COVID-19 data can enhance our understanding and provide valuable insights
